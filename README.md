# Blockchain Chatbot

Welcome to my Deep Learning Chatbot project!

This chatbot aims to answer basic questions about Blockchain using Deep Learning.

## How to use ?

I'm using Google Colab for this project and each time you disconnect from Colab your files and datas are delete. For this reason a quick set up is require before using my Chatbot:

- Download `files.zip` file of this repo on your computer.
- Open `Chatbot.ipynb` on Google Colab.
- Unzip `files.zip` on your computer.
- In Colab, add unzipped files (`dataset.json`, `checkpoint`, `model.tflearn.data-00000-of-00001`, `model.tflearn.index`, `model.tflearn.meta` & `data.pickle`. See images below).
- Then run and enjoy!
