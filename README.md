# Blockchain_Chatbot

Welcome to my Deep Learning Chatbot project!

This chatbot aims to answer basic questions about Blockchain using Deep Learning.

## How to use ?

- Open Chatbot.ipynb on Google Colab
- Add `intents.json` on files on the left in Colab
- If you want to train the model by yourself just run the notebook (can be long)
- If you want to use the model already trained add the `model.tflearn` on files in Colab
- Just run and enjoy!

You can find and download `intents.json` and `model.tflearn` files in this repo.
